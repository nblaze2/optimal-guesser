  # You can call the `check` method with a number to see if it

  # If the guess is correct, it will return 0.

  # If the guess is too low, it will return -1.

  # e.g. if the hidden number is 43592, then

  # check(50000) # => 1
  # check(40000) # => -1
  # check(43592) # => 0
  #
  # When you've figured out what the hidden number is, return it
  # from this method.
